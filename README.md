# Project
Files include what I worked on with a client. 
My portion of the project was newsletter cover page and a template. 
This code is not working code but a visual of the code of what I have done in the project from:

React.js where I implemented Axios calls, that on success collected data from the database into state allowing me to then Map and then render each item onto a card which has CSS that is all Paginated to sift through all the cards. Once loaded on the page there is a search feature that allows you to target a specific item from the database giving the user an ease of use or a getAll feature. Structured 2 Modals forms using formik that give the user the access to insert and update each individual card or if needed delete. 

.Net core is used as the Middle tier where I created Models, Requests, ApiControllers, Services, and a Interface that captures all calls made from the front end giving stability within the code for less errors to happen by users.


Sql stored procedures are using TSQL that include Insert, Update, Delete, getById, getPaginated, SearchPaginated.
